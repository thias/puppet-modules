Custom modules for Puppet, made for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS
=======================================================================

Overview
--------

The modules present here are either self-contained or depend exclusively on
other modules present here, detailed in each module's Modulefile.

The modules should all be very easy to understand and reuse. See each module's
README file for more information, as well as the auto-generated documentation.

One of the goal is to only perform the repetitive and generic parts, leaving
all specificties outside of modules, yet providing means to inteface them
cleanly. A good example would be the ISC BIND DNS server, for which zone files
installed with the provided definition automatically reload named when changed.

Support
-------

More generic puppet documentation can be found at http://docs.puppetlabs.com/

Documentation can be automatically generated with :
puppetdoc --all --mode rdoc --outputdir ./doc --modulepath modules --manifestdir /var/empty
